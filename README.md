- Languages: HTML, SASS, JS vanila 

#### Requirements: 
- I can enter my monthly gross income 
- I can enter my total days of sick-leave
- I can specify that I have tubercolosis
- I can see how much will my employer compensate me
- I can see how many days my employer has to compensate
- I can see how much will Health Insurance compensate me

### Roadmap
